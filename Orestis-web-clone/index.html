                            <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
                            <p>Dr Orestis Georgiou is an author of 6 patents, 1 book, and 100+ academic papers that have been published in leading journals and conferences of Mathematics, 
                                Physics, Computer Science, Engineering and Medicine. He has also been co-awarded R&D grants in excess of €10 million, including a Marie Curie 
                                Individual Fellowship, and is the recipient of the prestigious 2019 IEEE Heinrich Hertz award. Finally, as Head of R&D
                                Partnerships at Ultraleap, he is passionate about haptic 
                                technologies, networks, and spatial XR computing and oversees all 
                                our external R&D collaboration activities and grant-funded projects. </p>

                            <p>This is a book about mid-air haptics, generated by ultrasound phased arrays, 
                                and the novel human-computer interaction (HCI) paradigms it enables.
                                It’s co-edited with William Frier, Euan Freeman, Claudio Pacchierotti, 
                                and Takayuki Hoshi, and co-authored with 30+ experts in the field. </p>

                            <p>I believe that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be the most 
                                significant invention in the history of humanity. 
                                In this blog, I had the opportunity to talk to one.</p>

                                further refine my own ideas and research. It’s something I enjoy immensely and
